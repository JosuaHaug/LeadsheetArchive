\begin{verse}
When He rolls up His sleeves \\
He ain't just puttin' on the ritz \\
Our God is an awesome God \\
There is thunder in His footsteps \\
And lightning in His fists \\
Our God is an awesome God \\
And the Lord wasn't jokin' When He kicked 'em out of Eden \\
It wasn't for no reason That He shed His blood \\
His return is very close And so you better be believin' \\
That our God is an awesome God
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
Our God is an awesome God \\
He reigns from heaven above \\
With wisdom pow'r and love \\
Our God is an awesome God
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
When the sky was starless \\
In the void of the night \\
Our God is an awesome God \\
He spoke into the darkness \\
And created the light \\
Our God is an awesome God \\
The judgement and wrath He poured out on Sodom \\
The mercy and grace He gave us at the cross \\
I hope that we have not Too quickly forgotten \\
That our God is an awesome God
\end{verse}
