\begin{verse}
||: ^{Em}\wholerest~ | ^{C}\wholerest~ | ^{D}\wholerest~ | ^{G}\wholerest~ :||

The weakest man I know is the man I see in the mirror \\
But it's okay to be inferior when you know Christ is superior \\
Much stronger than my fears and doubts He's the Overcomer \\
He holds me when I'm overwhelmed by the weight my soul is under \\
From the highest throne is flashes of lightning and rolls of thunder \\
Yet he knows the number of hairs upon my head I'm full of wonder \\
That the One with universal power would be personal \\
With His creation as He unfolds His gracious purposes so perfectly \\
I was purchased by the death of Jesus crucified in weakness \\
I worship a God who weeped who intercedes for me while I sleep \\
Yes I know He hears my cries \\
He doesn't roll his eyes but rather He sympathizes \\
And reminds me that all my needs have been provided \\
I have no reason to trust that I could be strong \\ enough on my own
So I gladly boast in my weakness \\
That Christ's power might be shown \\
Manifested through my life to prove my faith is genuine when tested \\
Cause in the depths of my weakness is when my strength gets perfected
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}

Yea I understand what means to be branded as a biblical man \\
But I can't stand the fact that I \\
Still try to live up to man's standards \\
It's really hard for me to be perceived as needy \\
When everyone around me seems to be succeeding \\
While making life look easy \\
I'm constantly fighting this feeling of failing as a father \\
And this feeling of falling short as a husband \\
The sort of never measuring up \\
Of course it's all in my mind it's just an expression my pride \\
Yea I get it but it's still for me to admit it sometimes \\
I get so tired of taking refuge in my own strength \\
While standing with the weight of my insecurities on my back \\
Until my bones break \\
It won't make a difference to my situation as a whole \\
Whether I tend to hold it together for the moment \\
Or pretend to be in control \\
God mold me into a man who holds fast to your everlasting hands \\
Give me the strength that I need to get past my circumstances \\
God rescue me make my desperate attempts cause me to confess \\
My dependance \\
And may the depths of my weakness make strength perfected
\end{verse}
