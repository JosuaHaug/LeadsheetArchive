Have you seen him, not in years
How 'bout her, no but I hear \\
She's in Queens with the man of her dreams \\
Funny back then she said that about you

Que sera, you'll never guess who I saw \\
Remember Johnny babe, remember him we were best friends practically \\
Let's do this soon again, ten years is that what it's been \\
Can't believe how time flies by
Leaving you makes me wanna cry
