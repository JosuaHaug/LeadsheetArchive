\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
She ^{Em}spins and she sways to whatever song plays,
With^{D/B}out a care in the world.
And I'm ^{C}sitting here wearing the ^{Em}weight of the world on my ^{D}shoulders.
It's ^{Em}been a long day and there's still work to do,
She's ^{D/B}pulling at me saying  Oh Dad I need you!
There's a ^{C}ball at the castle and I've been invited and ^{Em}I need to practice my dancin
Oh ^{Em}please, daddy, ^{D}please!
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
So ^{G}I will ^{G/A}dance with ^{G/B}Cinder- ^{C}ella
^{Em}While she is ^{D}here in my ^{C}arms
'Cause ^{Em}I ^{D}know ^{G}something the ^{C}prince never ^{D}knew ^{Em} ^{D}
Oh ^{G}I will ^{G/A}dance with ^{G/B}Cinder- ^{C}ella
I don't ^{Em}want to miss ^{D}even one ^{C}song
'Cause ^{Em}all too ^{D}soon the ^{G}clock will strike ^{C}midnight
And ^{Em}she'll ^{D}be gone. 
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
 She ^{Em}says he's a nice guy and I'd be impressed
 She ^{D/B}wants to know if I approve of the dress
 She ^{C}says, Oh Dad the prom is just one week away
 And I ^{Em}need to practice my ^{D}dancin'
  ^{Em}please, daddy , ^{D}please!
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
But she ^{Em}came home today with a ring on her hand
Just ^{D/B}glowin' and tellin' us all they had planned
She ^{C}says, Oh Dad the wedding's still six months away but I ^{Em}need to practice my ^{D}dancin' Oh ^{Em}please, daddy , ^{D}please!
\end{verse}
