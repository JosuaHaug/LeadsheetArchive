\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
| ^{G}\quarterrest~ We are ^{D}\_\_ | ^{A}\eighthrest~ the body of the most high. \\
| ^{G}\quarterrest~ We are the ^{D}\_\_ | ^{A}\quarterrest~ bride of a Savior \\
| ^{G}\eighthrest~ And we fall ^{D}\_\_ | ^{A}\eighthrest~ for the king of the kingdom \\
| ^{G}\eighthrest~ As we sing the ^{D}songs of sal- | ^{A}vation\_\_
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}[numbered]
As we | ^{G}\_ stand ^{D}\_ For |^{Bm}those who cannot ^{A}stand \\
for them- | ^{G}selves  And we ^{D}love the | ^{Bm}loveless ^{A}\_\_ \\
And we | ^{G}\_ go ^{D}\_ |^{Bm}\_\_ Where your ^{A}light's not shining \\
|^{G}We are the ^{D}bo- ^{Bm}dy of | ^{A}Christ
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
| ^{G}\quarterrest~ We shine ^{D}\_\_ | ^{A}\eighthrest~ like a city on a hilltop \\
| ^{G}\quarterrest~ We boast in  ^{D}\_\_ | ^{A}\eighthrest~ the Spirit living in us \\
And we | ^{G}\eighthrest~ march ^{D}\_\_ | ^{A}\eighthrest~ On a road leading to freedom \\
As we | ^{G}\eighthrest~ reach out our ^{D}hands to the | ^{A}fallen\_\_ \halfrest~
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}[numbered]
And we | ^{G}\_  bring ^{D}\_  | ^{Bm}Living water ^{A} the thirsty \\
And we | ^{G}\_  live ^{D}\_ for the | ^{Bm}One who was \\
And ^{A}is and is to | ^{G}come So our ^{D}life |^{Bm}counts for something Grea- ^{A}ter than our ^{G}self \\
We are the | ^{D}body ^{Bm}of | ^{A}Christ
\end{chorus}

\begin{bridge}
| ^{Bm}\eighthrest~ And our anthem will be | ^{G}\eighthrest~ A song of praise to the King \\
| ^{D}\eighthrest~ He is worthy, | ^{A}\eighthrest~ He is worthy. \\
| ^{Bm}\eighthrest~ With one voice we will sing | ^{G}\eighthrest~ "Where oh death is your sting?" \\
| ^{D}\eighthrest~ He is mighty, | ^{A}\eighthrest~ He is mighty.
