\begin{verse}
^{F#m}God so loved, that he | ^Egave his son \\
to lay | ^Ddown his life for the | ^{F#m}sake of ^Eus. \\
He | ^{F#m}bore the weight of our | ^Esin and shame. \\
With a | ^Dcry he said, It is | ^{F#m}fin- ^Eished \\
Christ the | ^{Bm}Lord overcame the | ^Adark- ^Eness; \\
He’s a- | ^{Bm}live: death has been de- | ^Afeat- ^Eed
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
For He | ^Dmade us a way 
by which | ^{F#m}we have been saved \\
He’s the | ^ASavior of the world. | ^E\_\_\_ \\
So we | ^Dlift up a shout for his | ^{F#m}fame and renown \\
Praise the | ^ALord, praise the Lord \\
Jesus, | ^ESavior of the world. | ^{F#m}\_\_\_ \\
Jesus, | ^ESavior of the world. | ^{D}\_\_ ^A\_\_
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
We must | ^spread the word of His | ^soon return \\
to re- | ^claim the world for His | ^glo- ^ry. \\
Let the | ^church now sing of this | ^coming King, \\
crowned with | ^majesty, our Re- | ^deem- ^er \\
And He | ^reigns, ruler of the | ^heav- ^ens. \\
And His | ^name is Jesus, the Mes- | ^si- ^ah.
\end{verse}
