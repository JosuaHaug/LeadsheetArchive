\begin{song}[remember-chords]{title={Dancing in the Minefields},interpret={Andrew Peterson},key={C},tempo={}}

\begin{schedule}
I -- V1 -- R -- V2 -- R -- B -- V3 -- R
\end{schedule}

\begin{verse}
I was nineteen, you were twenty-one
The year we got engaged \\
Everyone said we were much too young
But we did it anyway \\
We bought our rings for forty each
From a pawn shop down the road \\
We said our vows and took the leap
Now fifteen years ago
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
We went dancing in the minefields
We went sailing in the storm \\
And it was harder than we dreamed
But I believe that's what the promise is for
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
\frqq I do\flqq~are the two most famous last words
The beginning of the end \\
But to lose your life for another I've heard
Is a good place to begin \\
'Cause the only way to find your life
Is to lay your own life down \\
And I believe it's an easy price
For the life that we have found
\end{verse}

\begin{bridge}
So when I lose my way, find me
When I loose love's chains, bind me \\
At the end of all my faith, till the end of all my days
When I forget my name, remind me
\end{bridge}

\begin{verse}
'Cause we bear the light of the Son of Man
So there's nothing left to fear \\
So I'll walk with you in the shadowlands
Till the shadows disappear \\
'Cause he promised not to leave us
And his promises are true \\
So in the face of all this chaos, baby,
I can dance with you
\end{verse}
