Of what | ^{A}\_ they |^{Asus}think You’re like, ^{A5}\_ \\
But | ^{A}I've heard\_ the |^{Asus}ten-der ^{A5}whis-per
Of love | ^{A}\_ in\_ the | ^{Asus}dead of night ^{A5}\_ \\
You tell | ^{D2(no3)}\_\_ me | ^{A/C#}that You’re pleased,
And that I'm | ^{Bm7}\_ ne-ver a-lone |^{E4}\_\_ \quarterrest~ | (\eighthrest~)
