\begin{chorus}[]
| ^{Dm7}\quarterrest~You fly in circles a- | ^{Am7}round my head 
| ^{Dm7}\quarterrest~While I sit on the | ^{Em7}edge of my bed \\
I | ^{Fmaj7}cry~- ^{Em7}y,~oh, | ^{Dm7}what have I done again? | \\ ^{Fmaj7}\halfrest~\quarterrest~It's hard not to | ^{Em7}hate who I am | 
^{Fmaj7}\halfrest~\quarterrest~It's hard not to | ^{Em7}hate who I am
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}[]
||: ^{Fmaj7}\_\_\_\_ | ^{Em7}\_\_\_\_ :|| \\
I chase the moment that when I had it I felt alive \\
But now that the thrill is gone, I feel dead inside \\
I feel like everyone know the secrets I wanna hide \\
And every time they ask me how I'm doing, I just say "I'm fine" \\
Too embarrassed to share it or maybe too much pride \\
I create my own prison, holding the keys inside \\

| ^{Fmaj7}\eighthrest~Punishing myself for all of these crimes \\
And I'm try-| ^{Em7}ing to convince God that I'm not a waste of His ^{Fmaj7}time \\
What's | ^Fwrong with me? Am I de^Cfective? \\
I keep on ma- | ^{Dm7}king a mess, why can't I ever get it together? \\
Soon | ^{Fmaj7}people gon' find out I'm not what they expected \\
They | ^{Em7}see who I really am then I end up rejected \\
I | ^{Fmaj7}try to stand tall, but these knees are collapsing \\
| ^{Em7}'Stead of asking for help these apps'll distract me \\
So | ^{Fmaj7}lonely, but so many people are friending me \\
While I po- | ^{Em7}st, I hope one day to be happy as I pretend to be 
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
||: ^{Fmaj7}\_\_\_\_ | ^{Em7}\_\_\_\_ :|| \\
Uh, I was thirteen the first time my momma caught me watching porn \\
She started screaming, she couldn't believe her last born \\
Was dabbling in something so destructive \\
I wish I could have said it was my last time, but nah, it wasn't \\
And the more I thought about it, the more I got bothered \\
These women I'm objectifying are somebody's daughters \\
I never really thought I had a problem till it followed me to college \\
And I felt debilitated by its bondage, uh \\
Became a Christian, heard about God's power \\
Couldn't see it in my life, but I could tell you all about it \\
Overloaded with knowledge, making so little progress \\
Became a public figure, but my struggles were in private \\
Only started tasting freedom when I'm being honest \\
And I learn that when I'm weak is when I'm seeing God the strongest \\
I know some people gon' be quick to throw stones \\
But I'll take all of those hits so you know that you not alone \\

And | ^{Fmaj7}after 28 years of ^{Em7}life, I decided \\
Every- | ^{Dm7}body's crooked, some just do a better job at hiding it \\
| ^{Fmaj7}\eighthrest~Oh, how good does ^{Em7}freedom taste? \\
I hope they | ^{Dm}give me the forgiveness they gon' need one day, I pray
\end{verse}
